## Guidelines

### Workflow

We use the
[Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
and review all changes we merge to master.

We appreciate any contributions, so please use the [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
and send us `Merge Requests`. 

### Patch files generation

Some components may use git patch files to add functionality or fix bugs, such
as linux kernel or u-boot. Please use the command below to generate such patches:

```shell
git format-patch --abbrev=12 --no-numbered --zero-commit --no-signature ...
```
