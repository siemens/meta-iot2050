Subject: [PATCH 070/119] HACK: net: ethernet: ti: icss-iep: Fix sync0
 generation on a compare event

commit 41e5c46849b5 ("net: ethernet: ti: icss-iep: Add support for generating
perout/PPS signal for am57xx variant") introduced support for generating
PPS signal using the following method:
- Configure sync0 in single shot mode with 100ms as pulse length.
	- This allows to generate a pulse on first compare event after
	sync0 is enabled.
- Adjust CMP[1] register to next second boundary on every compare event.

With this setup only one pulse is created after enabling the pps as
sync0 is configured in single shot mode. In order to create a pulse on
every compare event, sync0 has to be disabled and enabled after the
pulse is completed. There are 2 ways to do it:
- Create a hrtimer task which gets scheduled after completed the pulse. With
  this there is a possibility that pulse can be missed, but in current
  situation there is not other better way. $patch is implementing this.
- Trigger an interrupt on falling edge of the pulse. But hardware does
  not support for this interrupt.

There are other ways on how sync0 can be configured. Below gives details
on why other approaches are not taken:
- Cyclic generation: Where cycle time & pulse length is configured upfront.
		     Configuring cycle time upfront is a problem, as
		     cycle time is in IEP clock cycles and cmp event is
		     based on the IEP counter with compensation. This
		     way cmp event and sync0 signal goes out of sync.
- Single shot mode: This is the current implementation.
- Cyclic with Ack mode: Where cycle time is configured upfront. Pulse
			width is based on the Ack from software. In case
			if this is used, ack should happen in cmp
			interrupt handler. In this case, the interrupt
			handling and ack is fast enough that most of the
			times the pulse is not observed on the scope.
- Single shot with Ack mode: Where cycle length and pulse length is not
			     fixed. Pulse gets started with first compare
			     event. Pulse gets low with the ack from
			     software. This will have the same problem
			     as single shot mode and cyclic with ack
			     mode.

After these experiments, the possible approach is to use Single shot
mode and re-enable sync after every pulse. This patch is using a hrtimer
task for re-enabling sync and that is why it is marked as HACK.

TODO: Explore if the task can be offloaded to firmware and then revert
this HACK
