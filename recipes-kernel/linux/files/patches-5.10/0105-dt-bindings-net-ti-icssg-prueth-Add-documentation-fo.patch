Subject: [PATCH 105/119] dt-bindings: net: ti, icssg-prueth: Add documentation
 for half duplex

In order to support half-duplex operation at 10M and 100M link speeds, the
PHY collision detection signal (GPIO output pin) should be routed to ICSSG,
GPIO pin so that firmware can detect collision signal and apply the csma/cd
algorithm applicable for half duplex operation. A DT property, half-duplex
is introduced for this purpose. If board has the required modification
done, this DT property can be added to eth node of ICSSG, MII port to
support half duplex operation at that port.

On AM654x-IDK only ICSSG0 MII port 1 can be used.
