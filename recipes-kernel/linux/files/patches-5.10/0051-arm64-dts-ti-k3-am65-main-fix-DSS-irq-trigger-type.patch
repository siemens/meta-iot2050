Subject: [PATCH 051/119] arm64: dts: ti: k3-am65-main: fix DSS irq trigger
 type

DSS irq trigger type is set to IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING. For some reason this
results in double the amount of expected interrupts, e.g. for normal
page flipping test the number of interrupts per second is 2 * fps. It is
as if the IRQ would trigger on both edges.

In any case, it's better to use IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, like the other
devices do, which seems to fix this problem.
