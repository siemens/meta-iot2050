Subject: [PATCH] drivers: mmc: host: sdhci_am654: fix start loop index

ti,otap-del-sel-legacy/ti,itap-del-sel-legacy passed
from DT are currently ignored for all SD/MMC and eMMC
modes.
Fix this by making start loop index to MMC_TIMING_LEGACY.

Fixes: 8ee5fc0e0b3be ("mmc: sdhci_am654: Update OTAPDLY writes")
