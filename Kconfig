config IMAGE_EXAMPLE
	bool "Example image"
	help
	  This is the official example image with several tools as well as
	  Node-RED preinstalled. It comes without a graphical user interface.

config IMAGE_SWUPDATE
	bool "Example image with SWUpdate support"
	help
	  Based on the example image, this adds SWUpdate and changes the
	  partition layout to an A/B rootfs.

config IMAGE_BOOT
	bool "Firmware image for PG1, PG2 and M.2 devices"
	help
	  Build firmware images that are responsible for booting IOT2050
	  devices. Two artifacts are generated: iot2050-pg1-image-boot.bin
	  for Product Generation 1 devices and iot2050-pg2-image-boot.bin for
	  Product Generation 2 devices, including M.2 variants.

	  WARNING: Do not flash this image onto your device unless you know
	  that it fits AND you have an external flash programmer at hand that
	  allows to recover. Otherwise you risk to BRICK THE IOT2050!

	help
	  Build the image with a Preempt-RT kernel, rather than the default
	  non-preemptive one. This can help achieving better real-time
	  latencies with the device.

config SECURE_BOOT
	bool "Secure boot & Data encryption"
	depends on IMAGE_SWUPDATE && !IMAGE_QEMU
	help
	  Enable signing of boot artifacts (boot loader, unified kernel image).
	  Furthermore activate dm-verity integrity protection for the read-only
	  root filesystem.

	  This uses the public custMpk.key and certificate by default. Do not
	  use this key in production, it is for demonstration purposes only.

	  The writable persistent /var and /home partitions are encrypted as
	  LUKS2 partitions.

	  The reason of coupling the data encryption with the secure boot is to
	  have a proper integrity chain rooted in hardware (OTP, RPMB, etc.)

config SECURE_BOOT
	bool "Secure boot"
	depends on IMAGE_BOOT
	help
	  Enable signing of all customizable firmware artifacts, enforce UEFI
	  Secure Boot mode, protect sensitive U-Boot environment variables and
	  prevent interactive access to U-Boot during boot and also on boot
	  failures.

	  This uses the public custMpk.key and certificate by default. Do not
	  use this key in production, it is for demonstration purposes only.

	  NOTE: Only PG2 and M.2 devices are officially supported regarding
	  secure boot.

config OTP_PROVISIONING
	bool "OTP Provisioning"
	depends on IMAGE_BOOT
	help
	  Integrate OTP provisioning data into the firmware artifacts. Various
	  options are avaiable. By default, this will integrate the OTP command
	  data for provision two public key hashes and enable secure boot in
	  OTP. 

	  WARNING: This uses the dummy keys by default. Do not use these keys
	  in production, they are for demonstration purposes only.

config RPMB_SETUP
	bool "OPTEE RPMB setup for OTP key write"
	depends on IMAGE_BOOT && !SECURE_BOOT
	help
	   Enable one-time pairing between processor and secure storage
	   (RPMB on eMMC). Do not sign and distribute this version. Run it
	   only in a secure environment on the target device, then replace it
	   with signed production firmware and enable secure boot.

config IMAGE_QEMU
	bool "QEMU Image"
	depends on IMAGE_EXAMPLE || IMAGE_SWUPDATE
	help
	  QEMU image to boot image without real hardware. The device emulated
	  by QEMU is not identical to a physical IOT2050. This leads to missing
	  or limited features such as Arduino I/Os, only one ethernet port,
	  virtual debug serial port, qemu version of u-boot, no watchdog, only
	  virtual drives, performance issues etc.

	  WARNING: Please be aware of potential problems when using the image
	  for testing purposes.
