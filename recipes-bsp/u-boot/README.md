# Building and programming the boot loader

## Building the image

The boot loader for PG1 and PG2 boards is built like this:

```shell
./kas-container build kas-iot2050-boot.yml
```

After the build the boot images are under

```text
build/tmp/deploy/images/iot2050/iot2050-pg1-image-boot.bin
build/tmp/deploy/images/iot2050/iot2050-pg2-image-boot.bin
```

## Flashing the image

> :warning:
> Flashing an incorrect image may brick the device!

Write `iot2050-pgN-image-boot.bin` to an SD card and insert that into
the target device. Then boot into the U-Boot shell and execute there:

```shell
sf probe
load mmc 0:1 $loadaddr /path/to/iot2050-pgN-image-boot.bin
sf update $loadaddr 0x0 $filesize
```

## Recovering a bricked device

If the device does not come up anymore after flashing the boot loader, you can
recover it with the help of an external flash programmer. Known to work are the
Dediprog SF100 or SF600. Attach the programmer to X17, then run the following
on the host machine:

```shell
dpcmd --vcc 2 -v -u iot2050-pgN-image-boot.bin
```

Also, as alternative it is possible to use flash programmer which can work
with Winbond chips (W25Q128), as example - ch341a. The flash chip is located on
the back side of the board.

> :warning:
> This way is not preferred, please, use Dediprog flash programmers if possible.

Install flashrom with:

```shell
apt-get install flashrom
```

Attach the grabber to the flash chip, then run the following on the host machine:

If the the size of the uboot file doesn't match the flash chip's size (16M)
execute this command:

```shell
truncate -s 16M iot2050-image-boot.bin
```

Then upgrade the firmware:

```shell
flashrom -p ch341a_spi -c W25Q128.V -w iot2050-image-boot.bin
```

## eMMC RPMB key provisioning

To utilize the eMMC RPMB as the backend for secure storage, an otp key is
required to be programmed into the eMMC RPMB. This key is unique per-device.

A special firmware build is required to run in a secure operating environment to
program this key into RPMB. To build this special firmware:

```shell
./kas-container build kas-iot2050-boot.yml:kas/opt/rpmb-setup.yml
```

This will build a special OPTee binary for generating and programming the otp
key, together with a special U-Boot binary for kicking off the key programming.

> :warning:
> This special firmware must NOT be signed.
>
> This special firmware must run in a secure operating environment.
>
> To protected the programmed RPMB key, it is required to flash a signed image,
> program secure boot keys and enable secure boot.

When booting this special firmware, the RPMB key provisioning starts
automatically. The result could be checked either:

- By Linux `mmc` command (with `mmc-utils` installed):

    ```shell
    mmc rpmb read-counter /dev/mmcblk1rpmb
    ```

    Returned "RPMB operation failed, retcode 0x0007" means no RPMB key was
    enrolled. on the other hand, the write counter value of RPMB will be read
    out, for the very first time enrolled RPMB key, the message is like this:
    "Counter value: 0x00000cef".

- Or by checking the u-boot log, an successful provisioning is indicated with
  something like:

    ```
    Wrote 2 bytes
    Read 2 bytes, value = 1
    ```

    If failed, the log would print something like "Failed to write(read)
    persistent value".

You can also perform the key provisioning manually by breaking the u-boot
autoboot then manually run below commands in u-boot console:

```
mmc dev 1
optee_rpmb write_pvalue paired 1
optee_rpmb read_pvalue paired 2
```

`mmc dev 1` is for setting the eMMC as the current mmc device.

`optee_rpmb write_pvalue paired 1` triggers the RPMB key programming, then write
a persistent value 1 named with `paired` to the RPMB based secure storage.

`optee_rpmb read_pvalue paired 2` reads back the written persistent value for
checking.

The auto provisioning is actually calling these three commands, so you would see
similar return messages.
