Subject: [PATCH] arm: dts: iot2050: Disable lock-step mode for all iot2050
 boards

The PG1 A variant of the iot2050 series has been identified which
partially lacks support for lock-step mode. This implies that not all
iot2050 boards can support this mode. As a result, lock-step mode has
been disabled across all iot2050 boards for consistency and to avoid
potential issues.
