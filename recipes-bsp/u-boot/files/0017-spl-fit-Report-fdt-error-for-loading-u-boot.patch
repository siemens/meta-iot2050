Subject: [PATCH] spl: fit: Report fdt error for loading u-boot

Commit 71551055cbdb ("spl: fit: Load devicetree when a Linux payload is
found") made a change to not report the spl_fit_append_fdt error at all
if next-stage image is u-boot.

However for u-boot image without CONFIG_OF_EMBED, the error should be
reported to uplevel caller. Otherwise, uplevel caller would think the
fdt is already loaded which is obviously not true.
