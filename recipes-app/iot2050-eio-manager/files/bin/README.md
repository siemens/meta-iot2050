# Binaries for EIO subsystem

At the moment, there are two binaries for EIO subsystem:

- `iot2050-eiofsd`: EIO FUSE filesystem daemon.
- `map3-fw.bin`: EIO controller firmware.

Make sure these two files are present in this folder before building the EIO
subsystem support. Check the top level README.md for details of obtaining them.
