# IOT2050 Event Record

IOT2050 Event Record is using for reading and recording events, such as
power up, power loss, tilted, uncovered, watchdog reset and eio events.

The core is a RPC service implemented with the help of gPRC.

## Event record services

The `iot2050-event-record.service` and `iot2050-event-serve.service` are systemd
services, they could be managed by `systemctl`. The `iot2050-event-record` collects events from various source then consume the API exposed by `iot2050-event-serve`
to wrap the collected events as `IOT2050-EventRecord` events and save them to
syslog. Then these wrapped events could be read by `journalctl` or by gRPC APIs.

## Predefined events

### Power events and Extended IO(EIO) events

Power events and EIO events are injected to `journal(syslog)` by default.

To check them on IOT2050:

```sh
root@iot2050-debian:~# journalctl SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=IOT2050-EventRecord
Oct 23 22:36:12 iot2050-debian IOT2050-EventRecord[323]: IOT2050_EVENTS.power: 2023-10-23 22:36:00 the device is powered up
Oct 23 22:40:21 iot2050-debian IOT2050-EventRecord[323]: IOT2050_EVENTS.power: 2023-10-23 22:34:4 [2] power loss
Oct 23 22:40:21 iot2050-debian IOT2050-EventRecord[323]: IOT2050_EVENTS.eio: 2023-10-23 22:12:54 [11] slot1 lost
```

### Sensor events

By default, the sensor events, i.e. tilted and uncovered events, are disabled.
To enable them, please create a systemd drop-in for `iot2050-event-record.service`,
as follows:

```sh
cp /usr/lib/iot2050/event/iot2050-event-record.conf /etc/systemd/system/iot2050-event-record.service.d/
```

### Watchdog events

If watchdog event recording is expected, please refer to [WATCHDOG.md](./WATCHDOG.md).

## Development

### How to inject a new event?

First, please link the `EventInterface` to the customized application.
```sh
# In IOT DUT
ln -s /usr/lib/iot2050/event/gRPC/EventInterface /path/to/customized-app/gRPC/EventInterface

# In Source code
ln -s recipes-app/iot2050-event-record/files/gRPC/EventInterface /path/to/customized-app/gRPC/EventInterface
```

Then, use the `Write` and `Read` functions to communicate with
`iot2050-event-serve.service`, as follows:

```python
import grpc
from gRPC.EventInterface.iot2050_event_pb2 import (
    WriteRequest,
    ReadRequest
)
from gRPC.EventInterface.iot2050_event_pb2_grpc import EventRecordStub


def write_event(event_type, event):
    with grpc.insecure_channel(iot2050_event_api_server) as channel:
        stub = EventRecordStub(channel)
        response = stub.Write(WriteRequest(event_type=event_type, event=event))

    if response.status:
        print(f'Event Record writes event result: {response.status}')
        print(f'Event Record writes event message: {response.message}')

def read_event(event_type):
    with grpc.insecure_channel(iot2050_event_api_server) as channel:
        stub = EventRecordStub(channel)
        response = stub.Read(ReadRequest(event_type=event_type))
    return response.event
```

And, please find the api definition in `gRPC/EventInterface/iot2050-event.proto`.

### Regenerate the gRPC python modules if proto file changed

If the `proto` file needs to be changed when customizing a new application
to inject event, please update the gRPC in the original path as follows.

```sh
python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --grpc_python_out=. gRPC/EventInterface/iot2050-event.proto
```
